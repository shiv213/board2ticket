> Transforming whiteboard discussions into structured GitHub tickets automatically.

## üìã Overview

board2ticket automatically transforms whiteboard discussions about code issues into structured GitHub tickets by leveraging advanced computer vision, audio processing, and natural language processing technologies.

## üîç Problem Statement

Software development teams often use whiteboards for collaborative problem-solving and design discussions. However, valuable insights and decisions from these sessions are frequently lost in the transition to actionable development tasks, leading to:

- Information loss between ideation and implementation
- Time wasted on manual note-taking and ticket creation
- Difficulty maintaining context between discussions and code
- Limited historical record of design decisions

## üí° Solution

board2ticket bridges the gap between collaborative whiteboard sessions and actionable development tasks through a comprehensive multimodal pipeline:

1. **Capture whiteboard sessions** (video + audio)
2. **Process visual content** using advanced computer vision techniques
3. **Transcribe and analyze discussions** using audio processing
4. **Align visual and audio data** through temporal mapping
5. **Generate structured GitHub tickets** with all relevant context

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Image Processing Pipeline

- **Frame Extraction and Preprocessing**
  - Convert video frames to grayscale
  - Apply binary thresholding (threshold value 130)
  - Generate inverted binary images to highlight content

- **Content Detection**
  - OpenCV contour detection (cv2.findContours with RETR_EXTERNAL mode)
  - Filter contours based on minimum area (50px¬≤)
  - Extract precise bounding boxes

- **Intelligent Region Clustering**
  - DBSCAN clustering to group related content
  - Centroid calculation for content elements
  - Proximate element merging (eps=100)
  - Oversized region filtering (>40% frame width or >50% frame height)

- **Cluster Tracking**
  - Sequential frame processing
  - Pixel density change monitoring
  - Content update timestamping

### Audio Processing Pipeline

- **Silence-Based Segmentation**
  - pydub's split_on_silence (-40dBFS threshold)
  - 1500ms minimum silence for topic transitions
  - Precise timestamp generation

- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**
  - OpenAI's Whisper model for transcription
  - Timestamp-linked transcriptions

- **Semantic Clustering**
  - Text embeddings via OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small
  - Unsupervised clustering (Agglomerative or K-means)
  - Topic cluster identification
  - Temporal sequence preservation

### Multimodal Integration

- **Temporal Alignment** of whiteboard updates with audio segments
- **Context Enrichment** with codebase information
- **Vision-Language Modeling** for combined data processing

### Ticket Generation

- **Content Clustering** for related discussions
- **Metadata Generation** for structured ticket fields
- **Visual Reference Inclusion** for context
- **Codebase Integration** for implementation guidance

## üîÑ System Pipeline

1. **Codebase Contextualization**: Converting GitHub repositories into LLM-friendly format
2. **Video Processing**: Custom OpenCV-based pipeline for text and diagrams
3. **Audio Processing**: Segmenting and transcribing with pydub and OpenAI API
4. **Multimodal Summarization**: Vision-language model interpretation
5. **Temporal Clustering**: Timeline-based discussion grouping
6. **Ticket Generation**: Structured GitHub issues creation

## ‚ú® Benefits

- **Meeting Efficiency**: Eliminates manual note-taking and ticket creation
- **Reduced Information Loss**: Captures all whiteboard content and discussions
- **Improved Development Workflow**: Creates clear, contextual tickets
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Preserves collaborative intelligence
- **Historical Record**: Maintains visual and textual development history
