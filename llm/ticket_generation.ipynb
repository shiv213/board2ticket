    "Instructions:  \n",
    " - Analyze the image to determine what is being drawn or written (e.g., diagrams, flowcharts, annotations).\n",
    " - Read and interpret the transcript to capture the intended meaning or context behind the drawing.  \n",

    "## Key Features\n",
    "#### Components\n",
    "* Discord Bot (ImposterBot)\n",
    "    - Streamlines managing game lobbies and inviting friends via Discord\n",
    "    - Mutes all players during the game, unmutes them during voting \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Game Listener Executable (ImposterBot Among Us Game Listener)\n",
    "    - While you play Among Us, the Game Listener Executable will read Among Us game data and push it to the database   \n",
    "\n",
    "## How To Use\n",
    "One person in the game who is **in the voice channel** needs to do the following:\n",
    "- Run the `.info` command on your Discord server to get your server ID and voice channel ID (this is unique per Discord server)\n",
    "- Launch the Among Us game (this needs to be open before the next step)\n",
    "- Run the `ImposterBot Among Us Game Listener.py` file (instructions on where to find this below)\n",
    "- Input your server ID and voice channel ID and press `Start`\n",
    "- Get into a game of Among Us, and run the `.start` command in your Discord server once the game starts\n",
    "    - Note: for the time being, everyone will be muted in the lobbies as well as in the game (this will be changed shortly)\n",
    "- Once you're done with your game, run the `.stop` command in your Discord server\n",
    "\n",
    "## Download\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this bot on your Discord server, you need invite using this link: \n",

This would help catch exceptions and prevent the program from crashing.\\n\\nAdditionally, the image includes a heading \\\"#21: Error handling,\\\" emphasizing the focus on enhancing error management within the code.\",\n",

This approach lacks flexibility, as it requires manual adjustments if the game changes or resets.\\n   \\n2. **Issue 13** pertains to memory management, although specific details are not provided in the transcript.\\n\\n3. **Issue 41** involves error handling in the project. \\n\\nThe proposed solution for the first issue is to implement a function that dynamically loads the game's memory instead of relying on a static pointer. This would enhance the bot's adaptability and performance.\",\n",

It notes the need for a dynamic solution to avoid manual adjustments when the game resets or changes, suggesting the development of a function that dynamically loads the game's memory address. \\n\\nThis aligns with the objectives of maintaining flexibility in the code and ensuring smooth functionality as game versions evolve.\",\n",

This would allow for more persistent data storage.\\n\\n2. **Alternative Storage Format**: An emphasis on implementing a different storage solution that can save the game's state in a file format on the device. This would again reduce the dependency on in-memory global variables.\\n\\n3. **Error Handling**: A recommendation to enhance the code's robustness through the addition of try-catch statements. These should be strategically placed during state changes to handle potential errors and prevent crashes.\\n\\nOverall, the notes advocate for improved data management and error handling in the game\\u2019s backend.\",\n",

This means that the address can adjust to the current execution context rather than being fixed.\\n\\n2. **Global Database**: Currently, this serves as a transient storage solution for the game's memory state. The notes propose enhancements for persistence, especially since the global database resets when the game is restarted.\\n\\n3. **Persistence Solutions**: Two potential fixes are highlighted:\\n   - **Database (SQLite)**: A lightweight database could maintain the game state across sessions, allowing for data retention.\\n   - **Storage Option**: This could involve writing the game state to a file or some other format that is saved locally, enabling the game to recover its state even after resets.\\n\\n4. **Error Handling**: There's an indication that error handling needs to be addressed, although specifics are not provided in the text.\\n\\nOverall, the notes are focused on improving the memory management and state persistence of a game's architecture, enhancing its robustness and user experience.\"\n",

    "## Key Features\n",
    "#### Components\n",
    "* Discord Bot (ImposterBot)\n",
    "    - Streamlines managing game lobbies and inviting friends via Discord\n",
    "    - Mutes all players during the game, unmutes them during voting \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Game Listener Executable (ImposterBot Among Us Game Listener)\n",
    "    - While you play Among Us, the Game Listener Executable will read Among Us game data and push it to the database   \n",
    "\n",
    "## How To Use\n",
    "One person in the game who is **in the voice channel** needs to do the following:\n",
    "- Run the `.info` command on your Discord server to get your server ID and voice channel ID (this is unique per Discord server)\n",
    "- Launch the Among Us game (this needs to be open before the next step)\n",
    "- Run the `ImposterBot Among Us Game Listener.py` file (instructions on where to find this below)\n",
    "- Input your server ID and voice channel ID and press `Start`\n",
    "- Get into a game of Among Us, and run the `.start` command in your Discord server once the game starts\n",
    "    - Note: for the time being, everyone will be muted in the lobbies as well as in the game (this will be changed shortly)\n",
    "- Once you're done with your game, run the `.stop` command in your Discord server\n",
    "\n",
    "## Download\n",

We need to develop a robust solution for dynamic memory management:\\n\\n1. Create a `load_game()` function that dynamically loads the game's memory address\\n2. Implement a mechanism to automatically adjust memory pointers across different game versions\\n3. Replace static memory references with a dynamic pointer system\\n\\nBenefits:\\n- Increased adaptability to game updates\\n- Reduced maintenance overhead\\n- More resilient memory management\\n\\nProposed technical implementation:\\n- Use `int * dynamic_mem_pointer` to hold dynamically assigned memory addresses\\n- Develop a flexible pointer loading mechanism\\n- Add error handling and fallback strategies\",\n",
